## Requirements
* Xcode 4.3 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 4 or higher
* ARC

If you are not using ARC in your project, add `-fobjc-arc` as a compiler flag for all the files in this project.

## Demo

Build and run the `RECurtainViewControllerExample` project in Xcode to see `RECurtainViewController` in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating RECurtainViewController is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Edit your Podfile and add RECurtainViewController:

``` bash
$ edit Podfile
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod 'RECurtainViewController', '~> 1.0.1'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

### Simple Install

`RECurtainViewController` requires the `QuartzCore` framework, so the first thing you'll need to do is include the framework into your project.

Now that the framework has been linked, all you need to do is drop `UIViewController+RECurtainViewController.{h,m}` into your project, and add `#include "UIViewController+RECurtainViewController.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
DemoViewController *test = [[DemoViewController alloc] init];
[self curtainRevealViewController:test
                  transitionStyle:RECurtainTransitionHorizontal];
```
